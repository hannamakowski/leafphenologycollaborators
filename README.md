This space includes documents relevant to tree leaf phenology collaborations for K-12 and underraduate classroom collaborators working with Dr. Hanna Makowski at Black Rock Forest to collect data.


Currently the "Leaf Phenology Citizen Science Project.pdf" file contains background information and blank datasheets structured for K-12 classroom data entry. 


Materials for undergraduate classrooms a will be updated shortly. Additionally, I will have  pilot data from our first undergraduate classroom collaboration at Purchase College SUNY.
